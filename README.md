# Python-Video-Creator
Well, it's in the name, running the gui4python.py script will give you the gui.
But you must be wondering what it does in the first place.
If you don't feel like reading the code yourself, when you place a video in the videos folder, they will be combined together based on their number, here's an example:
Cat1, cat2, cat3, cat4, etc, cat1 get's combined first, and then cat2, you can change the prefix, such as: download1, download2, you can change it if you want.
When you place an audio in the music folder, they will be combined based on their number, such as: music1, music2, etc.
And when you place an image in the thumbnails folder it'll automatically place it in the bottom right place of the screen when you make the video.
gui-entrys is not finished yet, but that's fine, if you wanna use this chunk of code, you're gonna have to at least see the comments in defmovie and gui4python.
